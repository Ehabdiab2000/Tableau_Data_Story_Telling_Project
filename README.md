 Data Story Telling Baseball Data , By Ehab Mansour Diab
In this project I have done explanatory data visualization steps and to communicate the findings on the performance of baseball players. The analysis is done using Tableau and a data set containing 1,157 baseball players including their handedness (right or left handed), height (in inches), weight (in pounds), batting average, and home runs.
